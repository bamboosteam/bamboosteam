# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Takuma Takezawa.
Welcome to my profile! I am currently a Master's student majoring in Computer Science at the University of Southern California with a research background in image coding using convolutional neural networks [@Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english) and one year of professional experience in web application development [@SoftBank](https://www.softbank.jp/).

### Currently open to an internship role for summer 2023
As someone who is passionate about software development, I am strongly interested in opportunities as either a backend developer or a full-stack engineer. I am excited to leverage my skills and experience to develop innovative solutions that address complex problems.
