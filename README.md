# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Takuma Takezawa.
Welcome to my github profile! 
I am currently a Master's student majoring in Computer Science at the University of Southern California. I have a research background in wavelet-based image coding using convolutional neural networks, and I have one year of professional experience in web application development using a range of technologies, including PHP, Laravel, Java, Spring Boot, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, and PostgreSQL.

As someone who is passionate about software development, I am strongly interested in opportunities as either a backend developer or a full-stack engineer. I am excited to leverage my skills and experience to develop innovative solutions that address complex problems. I thrive in collaborative environments and am eager to contribute my knowledge and expertise to a dynamic team.
